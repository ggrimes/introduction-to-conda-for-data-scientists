## What is Conda?

From the [official Conda documentation](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html). 
Conda is an open source package and environment management system that runs on Windows, Mac OS and 
Linux.

*   Conda can quickly install, run, and update packages and their dependencies.
*   Conda can create, save, load, and switch between project specific software environments on 
    your local computer. 
*   Although Conda was created for Python programs, Conda can package and distribute software for 
    any language such as R, Ruby, Lua, Scala, Java, JavaScript, C, C++, FORTRAN.

Conda as a *package manager* helps you find and install packages. If you need a package that 
requires a different version of Python, you do not need to switch to a different environment 
manager, because Conda is also an *environment manager*. With just a few commands, you can set up 
a totally separate environment to run that different version of Python, while continuing to run 
your usual version of Python in your normal environment.

## Why should I use a package and environment management system?

Installing software is hard. Installing scientific software is often even more challenging. In 
order to minimize the burden of installing and updating software (data) scientists often install 
software packages that they need for their various projects system-wide. 

Installing software system-wide has a number of drawbacks:

*   It can be difficult to figure out what software is required for any particular research project.
*   It is often impossible to install different versions of the same software package at the same 
    time.
*   Updating software required for one project can often "break" the software installed for another 
    project.

Put differently, installing software system-wide creates complex dependencies between your reearch 
projects that shouldn't really exist!

Rather than installing software system-wide, wouldn't it be great if we could install software 
separately for each research project?

What I hope you will have taken away from the discussion exercise is an appreciation for the fact 
that in order to install project-specific software environments you need to solve two complementary 
challenges: environment management and package management.

### Environment management

An environment management system solves a number of problems commonly encountered by (data) 
scientists.

*   An application you need for a research project requires different versions of your base 
    programming language or different versions of various third-party packages from the versions 
    that you are currently using.
*   An application you developed as part of a previous research project that worked fine on your 
    system six months ago now no longer works.
*   Code that have written for a joint research project works on your machine but not on your 
    collaborators' machines.
*   An application that you are developing on your local machine doesn't provide the same results 
    when run on your remote cluster.

An environment management system enables you to set up a new, project specific software environment 
containing specific Python versions as well as the versions of additional packages and 
required dependencies that are all mutually compatible.

*   Environment management systems help resolve dependency issues by allowing you to use different 
    versions of a package for different projects.
*   Make your projects self-contained and reproducible by capturing all package dependencies in a 
    single requirements file.
*   Allow you to install packages on a host on which you do not have admin privileges.

### Package management

A good package management system greatly simplifies the process of installing software by... 

1.  identifying and installing compatible versions of software and all required dependencies. 
2.  handling the process of updating software as more recent versions become available.

If you use some flavor of Linux, then you are probably familiar with the package manager for your 
Linux distribution (i.e., `apt` on Ubuntu, `yum` on CentOS); if you are a Mac OSX user then you 
might be familiar with the [Home Brew Project](https://brew.sh/) which brings a Linux-like package 
management system to Mac OS; if you are a Windows OS user, then you may not be terribly familiar 
with package managers as there isn't really a standard package manager for Windows (although there 
is the [Chocolatey Project](https://chocolatey.org/)).  

Operating system package management tools are great but these tools actually solve a more general 
problem than you often face as a (data) scientist.  As a (data) scientist you typically use one or 
two core scripting languages (i.e.,  Python, R, SQL). Each scripting language has multiple 
versions that can potentially be installed and each scripting language will also have a large 
number of third-party packages that will need to be installed. The exact version of your core 
scripting language(s) and additional, third-party packages will also probably change from project 
to project.

## Why use Conda (+pip)?

Whilst there are many different package and environment management systems that solve either the 
package management problem or the environment management problem, Conda solves both of these 
problems and explicitly targeted at (data) science use cases.

* Conda provides prebuilt packages, avoiding the need to deal with compilers, or
  trying to work out how exactly to set up a specific tool. Fields such as
  [Astronomy use conda to distribute some of their most difficult-to-install
  tools such as IRAF](https://astroconda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). TensorFlow
  is another tool where to install it from source is near impossible, but Conda
  makes this a single step.
* Conda is cross platform, with support for Windows, MacOS, GNU/Linux, and
  support for multiple hardware platforms, such as x86 and Power 8 and 9. In
  future lessons we will show how to make your environment reproducible
  ([reproducibility being one of the major issues facing science](https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970)),
  and Conda allows you to provide your environment to other people across these
  different platforms.
* Conda allows for using other package management tools (such as `pip`) inside
  Conda environments, where a library or tools is not already packaged for Conda
  (we'll show later how to get access to more conda packages via channels).

Additionally, Anaconda provides commonly used data science libraries and tools,
such as R, NumPy, SciPy and TensorFlow built using optimised, hardware specific
libraries (such as Intel's MKL or NVIDIA's CUDA), which provides a speedup
without having to change any of your code.
